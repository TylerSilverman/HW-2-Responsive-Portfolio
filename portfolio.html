          <p>This photo shows me preparing to eat Chinese Hotpot. Hotpot is a traditional Chinese meal that is prepared with a base that can be spicy, mild, or have any flavor that interest your taste palette. It is prepared with raw meat and vegetables. All the food products must first go inside the soup base and cook for a few minutes depending on type of food it is. Some of the meats may take longer then others and its the same with vegetables. After the food is cooked you take it out and eat on a separate plate. The soup base is continually cooking items as you take them out and add more items into unti lthe meal is finished.  </p>

          <p>This photo contains my friends for a bachlor part trip. We went on cruise to the Bahamas while it was still safe. We were fortunate to get a photo together since the first 5 people we asked did not want to take the photo.</p>

          <p>This photo shows the background of the beach and little bit of the sunset in Coney Island, New York. There was a bit of breeze so we had sweaters on, but it really was not that cold.</p>

          <p>This photo contains a picture of my dog. Her name is Tyga-Lily. She is a mixed breed, and adopted her about 5 years around from the Humaine Society. Although she may look scary and intimating she is a loving dog. Very playful and hardly barks. Her weakness is that she is afraid of other dogs, so when walking she will walk on the opposite side of the dog that is passing.</p>
